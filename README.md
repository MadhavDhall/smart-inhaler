# SMART INHALER

The objective of the project is to develop a smart inhaler prototype based on advanced sensor technology and connectivity features, such as an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, a Hall Effect sensor, an OLED screen, and a magnet.

The inhaler is equipped with a Hall Effect sensor to detect each use. Additional sensors may measure usage patterns, environmental conditions, and medication levels. ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module Enables wireless data transmission, ensuring that collected data is accessible to both patients and healthcare providers. The Hall Effect sensor logs each inhaler actuation, and other sensors gather relevant health metrics, providing a detailed view of the patient's medication use. The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module transmits data in real-time, allowing healthcare providers to access current information on patient adherence and respiratory health. A user-friendly web interface allows healthcare providers to view patient data, monitor adherence trends, and receive alerts for any irregular usage patterns. An OLED screen on the inhaler displays usage information, medication reminders, and motivational messages, helping patients manage their health effectively. The prototype smart inhaler will undergo rigorous testing to validate sensor accuracy, data transmission, and overall functionality. Feedback from patients and healthcare providers will inform further improvements.
